The **Fall Time Mania Mapping Contest** is debuting this year and with the temperature already dropping, we would like to give you a warm welcome in this exhilarating contest! You can read the full details in the forum post linked [here]()!

This mapping contests stems from it's close seasonal partner, [STMI](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2050785?n=1), which targeted a specific mapping demographic being an only 6K keymode mapping contest without gimmick to try and get more people interested in the keymode which was a complete success, but this time around, all mappers are welcomed and we hope to see your entry soon!

FTMC will be a one difficulty, one song per submission contest from osu!'s Featured Artist listing. It will follow a specific judging criteria listed below and also expanded on in the [contest's forum post found here](). How should you map? Well, the editor is your canvas! You're allowed to map any style as long as it adheres to the rules and to the gimmick!

Is your map ready and you fulfill the criteria? Let's not keep you waiting no more! Submit through the [contest page]() here!
