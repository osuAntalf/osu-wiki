With the temperatures dropping rather quickly, we would like to give you a warm welcome to the **Fall Time Mania Mapping Contest**'s debut! You can read the full details in the forum post linked [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2145873?n=1).

This mapping contest originated from its close seasonal partner, [STMI](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2050785?n=1), which was an osu!mania 6K contest whose goal was getting more players interested in the keymode. After the contest's success, we now want to welcome all mappers by allowing submissions **from 4 to 10 keys!**

FTMC 2025 will be a one difficulty, one song per submission contest from osu!'s Featured Artist listing. It will follow a specific judging criteria listed below with the inclusion of a gimmick. Judging criteria and rules also expanded on the [contest's forum post found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2145873?n=1). How should you map? Well, the editor is your canvas! You're to map as your heart desires as long as you follow the rules!
